Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption â€”

 Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.
- Faster and suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.
- Main drawback: Key must be shared, which can be insecure.

Examples: AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish


 Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses two keys: a Public Key (for encryption) and a Private Key (for decryption).
- More secure for key exchange and authentication.
- Slower compared to symmetric encryption.

Examples: RSA, ECC, DSA
