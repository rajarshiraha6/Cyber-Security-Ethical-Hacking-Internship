 OSI vs TCP/IP Model — 

 OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
- Developed by ISO as a theoretical model for how network systems communicate.
- Has 7 layers, each with specific functions.
- Used mainly for understanding and designing network communication.

Layers (Top to Bottom):
1. Application – User interface (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS)
2. Presentation – Data formatting, encryption, compression
3. Session – Establishing, maintaining sessions
4. Transport – Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP)
5. Network – Routing, IP addressing
6. Data Link – MAC addressing, frames, error detection
7. Physical – Transmission medium (cables, signals)



 TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)
- Practical model used on the Internet.
- Has 4 layers (some OSI layers combined).
- Focused on real-world implementation.

Layers (Top to Bottom):
1. Application – Combines Application, Presentation, Session (HTTP, FTP, DNS)
2. Transport – End-to-end communication (TCP/UDP)
3. Internet – IP addressing, routing (IP, ICMP)
4. Network Access – Combines Data Link + Physical
